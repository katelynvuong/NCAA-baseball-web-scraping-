# fair-credit-baseball-web-scraping

This is my progress in developing my web scraping skills with Professor Michael McBride of UCI to help with his Fair-Credit Baseball project. End goal for me is to have automated code that goes through each day in the 2023 season on the NCAA baseball website and extracts the play-by-play data for each game and exports it into its own csv file.

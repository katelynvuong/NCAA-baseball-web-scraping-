# fair-credit-baseball

Practicing my Python and web scraping skills with Professor Michael McBride of UCI to help with his Fair-Credit Baseball project. The end goal for me is to have automated code that goes through each day in the 2023 season on the NCAA baseball website,extracts the play-by-play data for each game, and exports it into its own csv file. I should have data for the entire season to give to Michael to put into his ML model, and maybe then I can play around with the data myself.

UPDATE: 
Now that I've successfully scraped the data, I will be aiming to create missing MLB box score data from existing play data off RETROSHEET.

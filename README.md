# fair-credit-baseball-web-scraping

This is my progress in developing my Python and web scraping skills with Professor Michael McBride of UCI to help with his Fair-Credit Baseball project. The end goal for me is to have automated code that goes through each day in the 2023 season on the NCAA baseball website and extracts the play-by-play data for each game and exports it into its own csv file. I should have data for the entire season to give to Michael to put into his ML model, and maybe then I can play around with the data myself.

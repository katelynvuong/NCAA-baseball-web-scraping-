# fair-credit-baseball-web-scraping

This is my progress in developing my web scraping skills with Professor Michael McBride of UCI to help with his Fair-Credit Score project. End goal for me is to have automated code that goes through each NCAA D1 baseball team's website and extracts the play-by-play data for each game in the 2023 season and exports it into a separate csv file.
